Technical constraints:
Always use Yarn as the package manager.
Always use Jest when writing tests. Only write tests when requested. Tests should be in the same folder as the code they are testing.
Ensure scripts in package.json files have access to the environment variables by using `DOTENV_CONFIG_PATH=../../.env node -r dotenv/config <script>`.
Don't use Babel to transpile the code.
File names should use kebab-case.

If you are unsure about anything, ask questions before proceeding.
