# Beta Credentials Framework

## Overview

The beta Credentials Framework is a tool designed to create a common language for describing and comparing diverse credentials, including degrees, certificates, industry certifications, and more. It aims to improve credential transparency, comparability, and portability.

## How it's organized

The beta Credentials Framework is:

- Organized around competencies broken into two learning domains: knowledge and skills. The skills domain is further divided into three sub-domains: specialized skills, personal skills, and social skills.
- Structured in eight levels that indicate the relative complexity, breadth, and/or depth of learning achievement.
- Flexible, allowing for precise analysis of individual credentials rather than attempting to assign all credentials of a certain type to a fixed level.
- Able to establish a profile of levels of knowledge and skills associated with a given credential as well as an aggregate level of that credential.

## Guidelines for interpreting the Framework

- Domains are complementary, with specific competencies often reflecting a combination of knowledge and skills.
- Different credentials represent different patterns of competency attainment across domains.
- There is no presumptive level for any type of credential.
- Learners can attain competencies through many learning paths â€“ sequential and non-sequential.
- Competencies are presented through active verbs that declare what learners should do to demonstrate mastery.
- The Framework does not prescribe how well a learner must perform to demonstrate mastery.

## Eight levels of the Framework

LEVELS | KNOWLEDGE | SPECIALIZED SKILLS | PERSONAL SKILLS | SOCIAL SKILLS

5 | Demonstrates integrated and specialized professional knowledge within a field of study or occupational activity. This includes deeper theoretical and professional knowledge, including the scope, the core theories and practices and the limitations of the field of study or field of occupational activity. | Demonstrates an extended, broad range of specialized cognitive and practical skills. Identifies and frames complex problems in selected areas of study and work, and distinguishes among ideas, concepts, theories or practical approaches to solve those problems. | Takes responsibility for overall actions and results as well as exercises autonomy within broader parameters. Reflects understanding of different perspectives or approaches within an area of study and work. | Learns and works in complex and heterogeneous groups. Helps shape the work within a group in a learning or working environment. Presents clear, timely and relevant information on processes and results to the appropriate recipients.
6 | Demonstrates broad integrated knowledge concerning scientific principles and the practical application of a scientific or complex subject. This includes a critical understanding of the most important theories, a range of methods as well as relevant and innovative occupational and technical developments to address complex problems. Demonstrates knowledge related to the further development of a scientific or complex subject, a field of occupational activity or relevant knowledge at the interface of different areas. | Demonstrates and applies a comprehensive range of methods for processing complex tasks and problems within a scientific subject, field of study or field of professional activity. Differentiates and evaluates theories and approaches to selected complex problems within the chosen field of study or professional activity. | Undertakes self-directed pursuit of objectives and takes responsibility for such objectives. Reflects and assesses one's own and externally set learning objectives. | Plans and structures work processes in a collaborative manner, including within heterogeneous groups. Acts in an anticipatory manner while considering the interests and requirements of others. Evaluates the potential consequences for work processes within teams, instructs others and provides well-founded learning guidance.
7 | Demonstrates comprehensive, detailed, specialized and state-of-the-art knowledge in a scientific subject or in a strategically oriented field of professional activity. This includes demonstrating an extended knowledge in adjoining areas of study or work, major theories, methods and schools of practice in the field of study or profession, and their relationships to allied fields. | Demonstrates specialized technical or conceptual skills to analyze, consolidate and synthesize knowledge in order to identify and to provide solutions to strategic problems in a scientific subject or in a field of professional activity. | Exercises broad autonomy and responsibility for planning and developing actions in learning and work that initiate complex tasks or underpin substantial changes or developments. | Takes responsibility for leading groups, organizations or, where relevant, for work and roles of others within the scope of complex tasks.

## Glossary

Key terms essential for understanding the framework:

- **Competency**: A learnable, measurable, role-relevant, and behavior-based characteristic or capability of an individual.

- **Credential**: A documented award by a responsible and authorized body that has determined that an individual has achieved specific learning outcomes relative to a given standard. Credential in this context is an umbrella term that includes degrees, diplomas, licenses, certificates, badges and professional/industry certifications.

- **Knowledge**: What a learner knows, understands and can demonstrate in terms of the body of facts, principles, theories and practices related to broad general or specialized fields of study or work.

- **Skills**: What an individual can do in applying knowledge, completing tasks and solving problems (involving the use of logical, intuitive and creative thinking). Skills can be described in terms of types and complexity and include cognitive, technical, communication, interpersonal and practical skills.

- **Learning domains**: Categories of learning. The beta Credentials Framework is organized into two domains (knowledge and skills) and three sub-domains of skills (specialized, personal and social).

- **Levels**: A categorization within the beta Credentials Framework of competencies and learning outcomes based on the complexity, depth, and breadth of knowledge and skills.

- **Personal skills**: Competencies required to act in an independent and responsible manner in various situations, to exercise judgment, demonstrate critical thinking and problem solving, reflect on one's own actions and on the actions of others, and to continue to develop his/her own competencies.

- **Social skills**: An individual's ability to be aware of the behavior of others and of differing viewpoints, to communicate with others effectively, and to work effectively with people from diverse backgrounds and points of view.

- **Specialized skills**: Skills that are occupational and discipline-specific.

- **Stackable credential**: A credential that is part of a sequence of credentials that can be accumulated over time to build up an individual's qualifications and help that individual move along a career pathway to further education, different responsibilities and potentially higher-paying jobs.

## Guidelines for assessment

1. Identify the specific topic or skill to be assessed within the broader subject area.

2. Formulate a series of questions that progressively increase in complexity, covering various aspects of the topic.

3. Ask the individual to respond to these questions to the best of their ability.

4. Analyze the responses across the four domains of the framework:
   - Knowledge
   - Specialized Skills
   - Personal Skills
   - Social Skills

5. For each domain, identify the highest level that consistently matches the individual's demonstrated competency.

6. When multiple levels seem applicable, choose the lower level to be conservative in the assessment.

7. Provide an overall assessment, explaining how the responses align with the chosen level in each domain.

8. Offer suggestions for how the individual might progress to higher levels of competency.

9. Be prepared to clarify or refine the assessment if the individual seeks additional explanation or points out potential misunderstandings.
