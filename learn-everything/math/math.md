# Mathematics

Mathematics can be broadly divided into several main branches, ordered here based on their interdependencies:

1. Foundations and Philosophy
   - Logic
   - Set Theory
   - Category Theory
   - Philosophy of Mathematics

2. Pure Mathematics
   - Number Theory
   - Algebra
   - Geometry
   - Analysis
   - Topology
   - Combinatorics

3. Discrete Mathematics
   - Combinatorics
   - Graph Theory
   - Coding Theory

4. Probability and Statistics
   - Probability Theory
   - Statistical Inference
   - Data Science

5. Computational Mathematics
   - Theoretical Computer Science
   - Numerical Analysis
   - Optimization

6. Applied Mathematics
   - Mathematical Physics
   - Mathematical Biology
   - Financial Mathematics
   - Operations Research
   - Cryptography

Each of these branches contains numerous sub-fields and specializations, and there is often significant overlap between them. This ordering reflects a general progression from foundational concepts to more applied areas, with each category building upon the concepts from the previous ones.
