Certainly! I'll ask you questions about the first bullet point item for propositional logic, which is "Fundamentals," focusing on "Propositions and Truth Values." I'll use the beta Credentials Framework to assess your expertise level. Let's start with some basic questions and gradually increase the complexity.
Can you define what a proposition is in the context of propositional logic?
What are the possible truth values in classical propositional logic?
Can you give an example of a statement that is a proposition and one that is not a proposition?
How does the concept of truth values relate to the law of excluded middle in classical logic?
Can you explain the difference between a proposition and a propositional variable?
How do truth values of complex propositions (formed using logical connectives) relate to the truth values of their component propositions?
Can you describe a scenario where multi-valued logic might be more appropriate than classical two-valued logic?
How does the concept of truth values in propositional logic relate to the foundations of mathematics and computer science?
Please answer these questions to the best of your ability. Based on your responses, I'll be able to assess your level of expertise according to the beta Credentials Framework.
1. A proposition is a statement which may be either true or false.
2. In propositional logic, true and false are the only possible truth values. All propositions must be either true or false.
3. Positive example "All men are mortal", Negative example "Run faster" (as an imperative instead of a proposition)
4. The law of the excluded middle is the justification for limiting the possible truth values to just true and false. Without the law of the excluded middle, there is room for propositions which have uncertain or indeterminate truth values.
5. A propositional variables is a placeholder representing an arbitrary proposition. However, within the context of a given argument, the propositional variable must represent the same arbitrary proposition throughout the argument, meaning it can't represent one proposition in one part of the argument and a different proposition in a different part.
6. The truth value of a complex proposition can be determined programatically from it's constituents using the definitions of the connection operators and their order of operations. 
7. Most practical applications in live operate with substantial uncertainty as to the truth values of any relevant propositions, so in many cases Bayesian reasoning is much more useful. For example, it would be difficult to construct classical propositions to determine what I should eat for breakfast, since the set of relevant factors (available foods, dietary requirements, nutritional information, biomarkers) is both numerous and many of the individual elements do not have known truth values. Multi-valued logic can better represent the unavoidable uncertainty for this kind of proposition.
8. First-order logic can be proven to be both consistent and complete, meaning all provable propositions are true and all true propositions are provable. This works nicely with the limited truth values. However, any system complex enough to represent the natural numbers has the unexpected property that if it is consistent (all provable propositions are true), then it's consistency is unprovable. As a result, mathematical and computer science propositions must include the possibility of a proposition being undecidable, which acts as at least one additional possible truth value.


Thank you for your detailed responses. Based on your answers, I'll assess your expertise level according to the beta Credentials Framework. Your understanding of propositional logic fundamentals appears to be quite advanced. Let's break down the assessment:
Knowledge Domain:
