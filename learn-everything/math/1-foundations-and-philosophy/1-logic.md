Logic, as a fundamental branch of mathematics and philosophy, can be divided into several main categories:

1. Formal Logic
   - Propositional Logic
   - Predicate Logic
   - Modal Logic
   - Temporal Logic

2. Informal Logic
   - Critical Thinking
   - Argumentation Theory
   - Fallacies
   - Rhetoric

3. Mathematical Logic
   - Set Theory
   - Proof Theory
   - Model Theory
   - Recursion Theory

4. Philosophical Logic
   - Epistemology and Logic
   - Metaphysics and Logic
   - Ethics and Logic
   - Philosophy of Language and Logic

5. Computational Logic
   - Boolean Algebra
   - Fuzzy Logic
   - Quantum Logic
   - Logic Programming

6. Applied Logic
   - Legal Reasoning
   - Scientific Method
   - Decision Theory
   - Game Theory

7. Non-Classical Logics
   - Many-Valued Logic
   - Paraconsistent Logic
   - Intuitionistic Logic
   - Relevance Logic

Each of these categories encompasses various sub-fields and specialized areas of study. There is often significant overlap between these categories, reflecting the interconnected nature of logical systems and their applications across different domains of knowledge.
