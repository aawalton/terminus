# History of Treatment

## Overview

For almost all of the past twenty years, the defining factor of my life has been a severe undiagnosed chronic illness. I’ve sought diagnosis and treatment for chronic illness seven times, with little success. Dates for treatment are approximate, since they’re reproduced from memory.

## 1. Psychologist (2006)

As I was preparing to serve a mission at the end of 2005, I began exhibiting semi-voluntary shaking (I could exercise self-control to suppress the shaking, but did not initiate it. At first it was just my right arm, but at times spread to my whole body. As I went through the MTC and then served in Russia over the following 9 months, the shaking intensified and I began showing an array of escalating symptoms including severe GI discomfort, fatigue, headaches, joint swelling, social anxiety, and depression. The mission president connected me to a church psychologist based out of Germany who talked to me and then had me complete a stress assessment, which put me at the very top of the scale for stress. He then taught me about the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, gave me a 0-100 scale I could use to assess my stress level, and taught me to use deep breathing exercises to reduce it. These tools were sufficient to allow me to continue my mission and I’ve continued to develop and use them ever since.

## 2. Infectious Disease Specialist (2007)

About a year later, I was transferred from being a senior companion to the mission office, which was a significant reduction in autonomy and coincided with exposure to mold. Within a day, my previous symptoms returned and my joint swelling intensified until I couldn’t walk. I was taken to the premier hospital in the region (Novosibirsk, Russia) for assessment, and their top infectious disease specialist diagnosed me with Lyme disease, since I’d spent time in Illinois, where Lyme disease is present. However, I never spent time in any county of Illinois where Lyme disease was present, and the diagnosis was not upheld by later assessment, so I believe this diagnosis was in error.

## 3. Sports Medicine (2012)

Several years later I was working at Epic Systems in Madison Wisconsin and had excellent health insurance, so I decided to make another attempt to understand what was going on. At the time, I was once again showing the same symptoms in significant amount, including severe joint swelling. My primary care provider happened to be a sports medicine specialist who worked with the UW Madison football team, so he ordered an MRI to look for tears (none found) and then attempted to drain the most affected joint (my right knee). He drained 10x more synovial fluid than the synovial cavity was supposed to have and then tightly wrapped the joint. However, within days the swelling had returned, so he referred me to a rheumatologist.

## 4. Rheumatologist (2012)

The rheumatologist was the first to realize that the swelling was fully systemic, appearing in all of my joints, including the small joints in my hands and feet, which explained the foot pain that I’d frequently experienced when walking. She then ran diagnostics to check for all of the testable variants of arthritis, all of which came back negative, so my final diagnosis was “non-specific poly-synovitis” or “your joints are swollen and we don’t know why”. A standard treatment of a high dose of NSAIDs also had no impact on the swelling. The next proposed step was corticosteroids, but I was not convinced that the rheumatologist had taken into account the possibility of interaction between the steroid treatment and the stress disorder side of the issue, so I did not continue treatment at that time.

## 5. CBT Therapist (2022)

In the following ten years, our insurance was not a good, so I did not seek additional treatment until I hit a period where my symptoms greatly worsened. My next attempt was to use psychological interventions, since I hadn’t tried that yet, so I met with a standard therapist for CBT. After several months of sessions, I could not detect any difference from the treatment, so the therapist referred me to an EMDR specialist instead.

## 6. EMDR Therapist (2022)

Working with the EMDR specialist also did not show any improvement in symptoms, so I discontinued my efforts at a psychological intervention.

## 7. General Medicine (2022)

Since psychological interventions were not successful, I decided to try again at a medical intervention and met with a primary care provider. I described my symptoms and his response was “I can’t do anything about your stress”. He then prescribed a anti-depressant medication, which had not noticeable affect.

# Description of Symptoms

## Stress Level

My sympathetic nervous system seems to be much more effective than my parasympathetic nervous system. When I am exposed to stress triggers, I immediately experience elevated physiological arousal. However, after the stress triggers are gone, the arousal levels do not return to normal as expected, remaining high for days rather than minutes.

I can self-assess my stress level against a 100 point scale to within 5 points. 

- 5 - completely relaxed
- 15 - normal daily activities
- 25 - high intensity activities, such as sports
- 35 - extreme stress, such as having your boss yell at you
- 45 - literally being chased by a bear

Effortful work increases my stress level a moderate amount. Social interaction increases my stress level a high amount. Social conflict increases my stress level an extreme amount.

I have noticed that in addition to the current level of stress, there appears to be a “stress capacity” resource of some sort that measures how much total stress I can tolerate in a given day. I believe this is effectively the integral of my stress level, representing the impact that previous stress has had on my body. I’ve seen this referred to in the medical literature as “allostatic load”.

I spend 4-12 hours per day keeping my stress level within normal bounds through a combination of deep breathing exercises, hot baths, and exercise.

## Semi-voluntary Shaking

When my stress level goes above 30, I start to get semi-voluntary shaking, which I can suppress with effort but do not control. I believe this is the standard “gazelle shake” response to elevated stress, and works to reduce the stress level. This seems to have some benefit for me and doesn’t seem to hurt, so I usually let the shaking run it’s course. 

## Joint Swelling

When I experience extended periods of elevated stress, I get significant swelling in my joints, especially in my knees, but also in my hands, wrists, and feet. As the swelling increases, the joint swelling manifests in several distinct ways.

As my knees swell, my mobility reduces until eventually I cannot straighten my leg completely, which results in walking with a limp or being unable to walk entirely.

As the small joints in my feet swell, this leads to pain when walking due to the added pressure.

As the small joints in my hands swell, I lose dexterity, and it becomes difficult to perform tasks that require fine motor control, such as typing.

## Headaches

If my stress gets high enough, I’m guaranteed to get a severe headache. I sometimes get headaches at lower stress levels but have not identified a consistent cause or solution. Standard pain medicines don’t seem to have any impact.

## Sweating

I seem to sweat much less than most people do. When I’m healthier, I sweat more. When I’m less healthy, I sweat less.

However, when my stress levels are high before I go to sleep, I frequently experience severe night sweats. The night sweats appear to be more frequent and more severe the higher my stress level is before going to sleep.

## Depression

When I experience extended periods of elevated stress, I get stress-induced depression. I have high confidence that the depression is caused by the stress, since it starts after the stress starts and goes away after the stress goes away. I’ve worked with several therapists and have found that psychological interventions have had no effect. When my stress is low, my mental health is much better than average. When my stress is high, my mental health is much worse.

## Temperature Regulation

As my stress level increases, my body seems to lose the ability to regulate temperature, freezing even at warm temperatures or overheating even at cold temperatures. As I’ve gotten older and less healthy, I’ve had more issues with freezing and less with overheating.

## Immune Response

When I am exposed to an illness, I will frequently get severe fatigue and swelling even if I show no additional signs of illness. It seems like the fatigue and swelling happen as a direct result of the immune system response, even when the immune system response is successful.

## Adrenal Fatigue

After months of extremely elevated stress levels, I will eventually hit a condition I’ve called adrenal fatigue, where my energy levels go from consistently being too high to consistently being too low.

A few times, this condition has been severe enough that my heart rate has stopped increasing at all during exercise.

## Water

I naturally drink a lot more water than most people, averaging over a gallon a day. When my average stress level is higher, I drink more. When my average stress level is lower, I drink less.

## Stomach Cramping

Under extreme levels of stress (50+), I have occasionally experienced severe stomach cramping. I believe this is a standard symptom of extreme stress, so addressing the stress should prevent this as well.

## Asthma

Under stress, I develop breathing difficulties. Exercising with particulates in the air causes severe breathing difficulty (diagnosed as subliminal aromatic bronchitis), but other types of stress can also cause more mild breathing difficulties.

## Blurred Vision

Under high stress, my vision will sometimes blur, and I’ll need to lie down for a while before I can see again. This happens most often after standing up.

## Social Anxiety

Under extreme levels of stress (50+), I have occasionally experienced extreme social anxiety. I believe this is a direct result of the stress, so I am focused on the stress as the root cause. 

# Working Explanation of Symptoms

Since this chronic illness has been the defining feature of my life for two decades, I have put a substantial amount of effort into studying my symptoms, testing interventions, and evaluating potential causes. Earlier this year, I was surprised with a potential cause that had never previously been on my list of possible causes, and after several months of evaluation, I now have high confidence that I have identified the underlying root cause behind these issues as Autism + ADHD. 

Autism is a nervous system developmental disorder that results in drastically decreased neuronal pruning. Having more neuronal connections means that the brain responds more strongly to stimuli, which causes increased physiological arousal in response to both sensory and social stimulation. Increased physiological arousal causes increased allostatic load, which results in more frequent and more elevated fight or flight responses. Being in fight or flight more often results in all of the standard medical consequences of extreme elevated stress.

ADHD has a high cooccurrence with Autism and is relevant because the presence of ADHD can mask the symptoms of Autism and vice versa. 

While Autism is generally treated as a psychological disorder, Autism also has a strong medical component because of the medical impact of allostatic load on the body. 

# Indicators of Autism

## Deficits in Social Communication and Social Interaction

### Social Isolation

When I was 14, I found myself isolated and alone with almost no social connections and had difficulty forming new ones. To remedy this, I spent 18 months carefully studying how people interact until I was able to emulate the correct behaviors. As a result, I was able to make casual connections, though I was still unsuccessful at making close connections.

I prefer to spend long periods of time every day by myself.

### Social Sensitivity

I have extreme sensitivity to social interaction. I find social interaction stressful and will sometimes take extreme measures to avoid it, such as walking for four hours rather than asking someone for a ride.

I am rapidly drained by large social gatherings.

### Social Preparation

I routinely spent hours preparing for short social interactions. During that time, I go over all of the conversation topics and patterns I can imagine to increase the chance that I be asked to handle the interaction well in the moment.

### Rumination

If a social interaction has any friction, I will often ruminate over it for hours afterwards trying to figure out what I could have done differently to avoid that friction.

### Speech Issues

I needed several years of speech therapy as a child. Under stress, my ability to express myself in speech breaks down. I find it much easier to communicate in writing rather than verbally, even with those closest to me.

### Bullying

I was frequently bullied as a child for being different and weird, not fitting in to the social norms of my peers.

### Difficulty with Implicit Communication

I have difficulty understanding implicit communication. I generally can’t tell if someone likes me. If someone is sarcastic, I would often take them literally, and then pass it off as a joke when they were surprised. In general, I have a tendency to interpret communication much more literally than intended.

### Difficulty with Implicit Rules

I have trouble when the explicit rules and the implicit rules differ. For example, when I started driving, I would always follow the posted speed limit and I couldn’t understand why so many people were breaking the law. It took years for me to understand that the implicit rules around speeding were different from the explicit ones.

## Restricted, Repetitive Patters of Behavior

### Stimming

While I generally exhibit socially acceptable stims such as walking, controlled breathing, fidgeting, or bouncing, I also exhibit less socially acceptable stims under pressure, such as scratching or pinching myself.

Walking is my primary stim, to the point that I have trouble thinking, eating, or talking if I’m not walking at the same time.

### Clothing

I have a single pattern of clothing that I wear under almost all circumstances, with the only exception being a white shirt for Sunday.

### Interests

I have a set of consistent special interests that I have pursued consistently for years. Because of the interaction between Autism and ADHD, my special interests are broader and more varied than those normally seen, but they are still recognizable. I have no interest in many things that seem to have broad appeal, such as sports and popular culture.

1. Understanding Myself
2. Learning Everything
3. LitRPG
4. The Elder Scrolls Online

### Activities

I do the same things every day. However, to satisfy my ADHD need for novelty, the things I do every day also must be different. To manage both of these at the same time, I mix up the order of what I am doing every day. I have elaborate systems built in spreadsheets and custom apps to help me balance my parallel needs for consistency and novelty.

### Environment

I need my environment to be consistent and predictable. Unpredictable environments take significant effort for me to navigate.

## Non-DSM Indicators

### Sensory Sensitivity

I have significant sensory sensitivities to touch, sight, smell, taste, and sound. I need significant noise cancellation to bring the ambient volume down to something tolerable. I have one specific brand of lotion in every room in my house because my hands feel awful without it. I need sunglasses when outdoors or driving. I have carefully selected my clothes to avoid issues with texture. I have to avoid several categories of food that give me sensory issues, whether or not I enjoy the taste.

I recently got an IV as part of a surgery for a broken wrist and the IV was much more painful to me than the broken bone. 

### Family History

Autism is highly heritable, with estimates of heritability ranging from 60-80%. I have multiple ASD diagnoses in my extended family on my mom’s side and my son shows clear signs of ASD. 

I also have multiple ADHD diagnoses on both my mom and dad’s sides of the family.

### Math / Engineering

Autism has a high correlation with engineering. On my mom’s side (where all the ASD diagnoses are), we’ve joked for years about having something in our genetics that makes us great engineers. Both of my grandparents on that side showed signs of ASD. Of their kids, 9 out of 11 ended up in engineering, including two of the daughters (one is my mom). Out of around 50 cousins, 80% ended up in engineering in some form.

I was likely the most gifted at math and science as a kid. At the age of four, I was doing algebra in my head. In sixth-grade, I tutored the advanced math teacher.

### Intelligence and Memory

The increase in neuronal connectivity means that all stimulus is more impactful. For me, that has resulted in an improved memory and ability to learn. I have routinely scored in the 99th percentile on standardized tests and in the past have memorized hundreds of pages of books.

### Early Almost Diagnosis

My paternal grandfather has a PhD in special needs psychology and told my parents that he thought I was on the border for autism at a time when the diagnostic criteria were much more restrictive.

### Autistic Shutdowns

I frequently experience autistic shutdowns where my nervous system is overwhelmed and I lose the ability to do normal tasks.

### Autistic Burnout

I have shown all of the standard signs of progressive autistic burnout, including reduced interest in activities, depression, and suicidal ideation. These symptoms have alleviated as I’ve reduced load and further improved when I stopped working. 

### Lack of Habituation

Autistics don’t habituate to stimulus or activities the way allistics do. This features prominently in my life. As a result, I find myself paying close attention on routine tasks, such as opening a doorknob.

### Alexithymia

While I do experience emotions, I find that my ability to understand, manage, and reason with my own emotions is greatly diminished. Under stress, I dissociate from my emotions. I find that I identify strongly with autistic characters in media, such as Sherlock Holmes, Sheldon, Spock, and Data.

### Hyperlexia

Many autistics show increased verbal proficiency at a young age, which was definitely true for me.

### Old Souls

Many autistics describe the experience of feeling old for their age. As a child, I would always join the adults at family gatherings rather than the other children, since they just made more sense to me.

### Black and White Thinking

Many autistics show patterns of rigid extreme thinking. I have improved in this respect over the years, but I definitely showed this pattern as a child, and I still have to actively avoid it as an adult.

### Identity

I felt strongly that I was different from everyone around me and never found someone who I identified with until I started meeting people who were diagnosed with both Autism and ADHD. As I heard their experiences, I immediately felt that these were people who were like me.

### Comorbidities

Autism comes with significantly increased likelihood for several other issues. Bayes’ Rule means that the presence of the other issues increases the likelihood of the presence of Autism. Relevant connected issues present in myself or close family members include:

- Immune system disorders
- Connective tissue disorders
- Sleep disorders
- ADHD
- Anxiety
- Depression
- POTS

### Interoception

Autistics frequently have trouble with determining the inner state of their body (interoception). That is definitely true for me. I have trouble telling when I’m hungry, thirsty, or tired until it’s really obvious. I also have trouble telling how hot or cold something is on touch or how loud a sound is.

### Common Diagnosis Pattern

Apparently it is quite common for my generation to be diagnosed as a result of having a child diagnosed, which makes sense given the high heritability.

# Current Severity

While my coping mechanisms have significantly improved year by year, my overall health has declined year by year, consistent with progressive autistic burnout. The most successful interventions I’ve found have consistently involved reducing the load on my nervous system. 

Sensory interventions have been helpful, such as noise-cancelling headphones, sunglasses, long sleeves, weighted blankets, but I’ve continued to see a gradual decline even with those interventions.

Lifestyle interventions have been even more successful. As I’ve gradually moved from in-person to remote work and from full-time to part-time, I’ve seen a reduction in the rate of decline, but I have still seen a gradual decline.

I was recently fired from a part-time fully-remote position in a company where I had significant accommodations and support. As a result, I think I’ve reached the end of my ability to maintain employment.

# Next Steps

## Marketplace Insurance

I lose access to my current health insurance at the end of October, so I’ll need to do some research to identify an appropriate replacement on the marketplace that will cover the necessary assessment.

## Autism + ADHD Assessments

Once I have marketplace insurance, I expect I’ll need a referral for Autism and ADHS assessments. I’ll need to select an assessment location based on insurance requirements and availability. Autism assessment often has long wait times.

## SSDI Claim

In parallel with getting on the wait list for assessment, I believe it’s time to start the process for an SSDI claim, so I’ll start looking for a disability attorney I can work with.
