# Number Meanings

## Fundamentals
The numerical language is built on five primitive concepts (1-5). All other numbers are derived from these primitives according to strict derivation rules, where each non-primitive number has exactly two parent numbers. The meaning of each derived number combines and builds upon the meanings of its parent numbers.
