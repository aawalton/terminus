# Notation Structure

Throughout this document, the following notation is used:
- n = [x] indicates that x is the canonical representation of the decimal number n
- For example: 5 = [(4)] means that (4) is the canonical representation of the decimal number 5
- When discussing derivation, a = [x] derives from b = [y] means that the representation x contains y within it

# Mythology

The Makers of Terminus use a number system and language based on the Fibonacci system.

# Notation

Rather than use a fixed base notation like those generally used with Arabic numerals, the Makers use notation with bases from the Fibonacci sequence. 

Translated into English, the notation can be represented with a function () which converts from an index in the Fibonacci sequence to the corresponding value. For example (4) = 5 and ((4)) = (5) = 8.

Using dynamic bases this way, all numbers can be represented with just two symbols: 1 and (), which can be represented in binary. To make written notation more compact, 5 symbols are used: 1, 2, 3, 4, ( ). 

Adjacent numerals are added. Numbers inside parenthesis convert from an index to the corresponding value.

# Symbols

The four numerals are represented as follows.

1. â€¢
2. |
3. ^
4. x

Open and close parentheses are considered two halves of the same symbol, and are represented by curved lines as in English.
5. ( )

# Important Numbers

The math of the Makers is based in the Fibonacci sequence, with a focus on Fibonacci numbers that have indexes which are themselves Fibonacci numbers.

Simple numbers are the base numerals. Pure numbers are numbers with a single simple numeral and one or more functions. These are the most important numbers.

The simple numerals 1, 2, 3, and 4 represent respectively, identity, difference, divinity, and corruption, with 3 being the single most meaningful number of all.

The first pure number is (x) = 5 which represents change.

The second pure number is ((x)) = 8 which represents abundance.

The third pure number is (((x))) = 34 which represents ascension, the transition of corruption to divinity, mortality to immortality.

The fourth pure number is ((((x)))) = 9,227,465 which represents the world, the universe, or everything that exists. This is also the number of Makers, the number of words in the language of the Makers, and the number of Towers on the Terminus.

The fifth pure number is (((((x))))) which has approximately 1,928,414 digits in decimal representation and starts with 507. This number represents infinity. Some believe that the ultimate purpose of the Terminus is to gather this much essence and that if a Maker were to acquire this much essence they would ascend to a higher plane of existence.

# Grammar

Each word in the language corresponds to a number. Words are separated with pauses which are written as spaces.

The language has no conjugations, declensions, tenses, person markers, or gender markers. The same work can be used as a noun, an adjective, or a verb.

# Names

The names of the Makers are numbers, with smaller numbers having more prestige, and with cohorts up to small pure numbers presiding over cohorts down to and including the next pure number.

There are ((((x)))) = 9,227,465 total Makers. Makers are ordered based on the total essence of their being. To become a maker, you must exceed the total essence of the lowest maker. Each Maker has Authority over a part of the System that corresponds to their name.

Every sentient being connected to the system also has a number, ranked by total essence collected. 

# Levels

Levels are acquired based on total essence absorbed, following the progression of the Fibonacci sequence.

1. 1
2. 2
3. 3
4. 5
5. 8

The maximum level is ((((4)))), which requires (((((4))))) experience, at which point it is believed that the person would ascend to a higher plane.
